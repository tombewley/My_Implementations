# My Implementations
Python implementations of some core ML models and training pipelines. These currently stand at:

- A fully-connected feedforward neural network.
- A binary axis-aligned decision tree (forked from [here](https://github.com/joachimvalente/decision-tree-cart)).
- A differentiable decision tree following Suarez and Lutsko’s algorithm.
- A deep Q network RL model (forked from [here](https://github.com/tokb23/dqn/blob/master/dqn.py)).
- An advantage actor-critic RL model (forked from [here](http://inoryy.com/post/tensorflow2-deep-reinforcement-learning/)).

- Ross and Bagnell’s Dataset Aggregation (`DAgger`) pipeline for imitation learning.
