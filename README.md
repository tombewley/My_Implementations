# My_Implementations
Python implementations of some core ML models. These currently stand at:

- A fully-connected feedforward neural network.
- A binary axis-aligned decision tree (forked from [here](https://github.com/joachimvalente/decision-tree-cart)).
- A deep Q network (forked from [here](https://github.com/tokb23/dqn/blob/master/dqn.py) and built on top of TensorFlow with Keras).
